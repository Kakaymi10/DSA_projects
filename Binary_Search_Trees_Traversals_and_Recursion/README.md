Problem
In this notebook, we'll focus on solving the following problem:

QUESTION 1: As a senior backend engineer at Jovian, you are tasked with developing a fast in-memory data structure to manage profile information (username, name and email) for 100 million users. It should allow the following operations to be performed efficiently:

Insert the profile information for a new user.
Find the profile information of a user, given their username
Update the profile information of a user, given their usrname
List all the users of the platform, sorted by username
You can assume that usernames are unique.

Along the way, we will also solve several other questions related to binary trees and binary search trees that are often asked in coding interviews and assessments.
